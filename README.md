The Budgie Desktop is a feature-rich, modern desktop designed to keep out the way of the user.

## Components

Budgie Desktop consists of a number of components to provide a more complete desktop experience.

### Budgie Menu

The main Budgie menu provides a quick and easy to use menu, suitable for both mouse and keyboard driven users. Features search-as-you-type and category based filtering.

### Raven

Raven provides an all-in-one center for accessing your calendar, controlling sound output and input (including per-app volume control), media playback and more. As well as supporting the usual level of media integration you'd expect, such as media player controls on notifications, support for cover artwork, and global media key support for keyboards, Raven supports all MPRIS compliant media players.

When one of these players are running, such as VLC, Rhythmbox or even Spotify, an MPRIS controller is made available in Raven for quick and simple control of the player, as well as data on the current media selection.

Raven also enables you to access missed notifications, with the ability to swipe away individual notifications, app notifications, and all notifications.

#### Notifications

Budgie Desktop supports the freedesktop notifications specification, enabling applications to send visual alerts to the user. These notifications support actions, icons as well as passive modes.

### Run Dialog

The Budgie Run Dialog provides the means to quickly find an application in a popup window. This window by default is activated with the `ALT+F2` keyboard shortcut, providing keyboard driven launcher facilities.

#### PolicyKit integration

The `budgie-polkit-dialog` provides a PolicyKit agent for the session, ensuring a cohesive and integrated experience whilst authenticating for actions on modern Linux desktop systems.

## Testing

As and when new features are implemented - it can be helpful to reset the configuration to the defaults to ensure everything is still working ok. To reset the entire configuration tree, issue:

```bash
budgie-panel --reset --replace &!
```
